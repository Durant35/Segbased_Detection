## INPUT DATA

+ use the localization result in the submap of Laser T&R
+ and the submap, and a raw scan of VLP16

## PROCESS

+ use the kdtree to remove the background, keep the dynamic ojects(people, cars, etc) on.
+ Cluster on the objects.

## Results

+ laserScan on the subMap:

![](./image/1.png)

+ Use Knn to get the outliers:

![](./image/2.png)

+ the cluster results:

![](./image/0.png)

+ Process:

![](./image/4.png)

## PROBLEM

+ There is problem in the clustering algorithm. 
+ Maybe the true EMST is really needed.
+ Many of cluster methods are waiting for me! 

## Thanks

+ Thanks to Oxford Robotics Institue
